# liri-node-app
This is application uses Node.js to create a LIRI application (Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface) which allows the user to use the command line node app that accepts the values of certain parameters and returns data. For instance, a user can run node liri.js and include the following command and it will output the data related to the user’s request.

## How to use
Install npm packages via terminal command line.


# What each command should do:

Retrieves song information for a track. If no argument is passed, song defaults to "The Sign" by Ace of Base.
```
spotify-this-song
```
Retrieves movie information for a movie. If no argument is passed, movie defaults to "Mr. Nobody".
```

```
Retrieves venue location and date of event for a concert.
```

```
Using the fs Node package, LIRI will take the text inside of random.txt and then use it to call one of LIRI’s commands.
```
